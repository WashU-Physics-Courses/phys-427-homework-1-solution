# Physics 427 Homework 1

__Due 11:59pm Monday 9/6/2023__

The deadline is pushed back to 9/6 due to Labor Day. You can push to this repository as many times as you want until the deadline, after which the repository will automatically become read-only.

## 1. Machine Precision

In C++, you can access the machine precision for `float`, `double`, and `long double` types using the standard library function `std::numeric_limits<T>::epsilon()`, where `T` is one of the floating point types. In order to use this function, you need to include the `<limits>` header file.

Write a simple C++ program to print this value for all of the three basic floating point types. Your output should look like this (replacing anything in square brackets with your numerical choices and results):

``` markdown
float epsilon: [SOME NUMBER]
double epsilon: [SOME NUMBER]
long double epsilon: [SOME NUMBER]
```

Verify that these are indeed the correct machine precision by printing whether `(1.0 + delta == 1.0)` is true. This expression will evaluate to `1` if true, and `0` otherwise. Remember `1.0` is automatically interpreted as a `double` in C++. Print the following for the machine epsilon of `double` type:

``` markdown
1.0 + epsilon == 1.0: [0 or 1]
1.0 + epsilon / 2.0 == 1.0: [0 or 1]
```

Name your source file `problem1.cpp` in the homework repository. Include its output in a separate text file `problem1.txt`. You can create such a file using the "redirect" command `>`, which takes the standard output from the command on the left and pass it as input to the file on the right. For example, the following command can generate such a text file:

``` sh
./a.out > problem1.txt
```

Commit and push both `problem1.cpp` and `problem1.txt` to the homework repository.

## 2. Quadratic Solver

Write a C++ header that defines two functions. The two functions should have the following signatures:

``` c++
std::tuple<double, double> solve_quadratic_1(double a, double b, double c);
std::tuple<double, double> solve_quadratic_2(double a, double b, double c);
```

Function 1 implements the usual quadratic formula that solves the algebraic equation $ax^{2} + bx + c = 0$:

$$
    x_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm\sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}}{2a}.
$$

Function 2 implements the more stable quadratic formula:

$$
    \displaystyle x_{1} = \frac{q}{a},\quad x_{2} = \frac{c}{q}
$$

where

$$
    q = -\frac{1}{2}\left[b + \text{sgn}(b)\sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}\right]
$$

This way of solving the quadratic equation avoids the case when $b^2\gg 4ac$, hence $b$ and $\sqrt{b^2-4ac}$ are indistinguishable within numerical precision. Since $q$ does not involve the difference between two very close numbers, it behaves better for some combinations of coefficients.

The `std::tuple<double, double>` type is a two-element tuple that contains two `double` numbers. This is the main way to return multiple results from a single function, since by default C++ only allows one return value. You'll need to include the header file `<tuple>`. You can create a tuple from two numbers `x1` and `x2` using the function `std::make_tuple(x1, x2)`.

You can print the content of a tuple $x$ using the following line of code:

``` c++
std::cout << "x1 = " << std::get<0>(x) << ", x2 = " << std::get<1>(x) << std::endl;
```

Name your header file `problem2.h` in the homework repository. Write a program `problem2.cpp` to test out these functions for a few different combinations of $(a, b, c)$ parameters. Include:

1. At least one example of $(a, b, c)$ that produces no real solutions. Note what the output is.
1. At least one example of $(a, b, c)$ that produces only one real solutions. Note what the output is.
2. At least one example of $(a, b, c)$ that produces different results for these two implementations. 

Organize your output as follows (replacing anything in square brackets with your numerical choices and results):

``` markdown
Method [1 or 2]: ([a], [b], [c]): x1 = [SOME NUMBER], x2 = [SOME NUMBER]
Method [1 or 2]: ([a], [b], [c]): x1 = [SOME NUMBER], x2 = [SOME NUMBER]
...
```

Include the output in a separate text file `problem2.txt`. Commit and push all 3 files to the homework repository. Remember to make sure that `problem2.txt` is the exact output of the program compiled from `problem2.cpp`.

## 3. Stability of a Recurrence Relation

The "Golden mean":

$$
    \phi \equiv \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2} \approx 0.61803398
$$

satisfies the following recursion relation:

$$
    \phi^{n+1} = \phi^{n-1} - \phi^{n}
$$

Use this recursion relation to write a simple function to calculate $\phi^{n}$ for a given positive integer $n$. Print out $\phi^{n}$ for $n\in [1,\dots,30]$ and compare the result from the recursion relation with simply calculating the power using `std::pow(phi, n)`. Use double precision for all numbers. Organize your output like the following:

``` markdown
phi^1: [RESULT FROM RECURSION] vs [RESULT FROM POW]
phi^2: [RESULT FROM RECURSION] vs [RESULT FROM POW]
phi^3: [RESULT FROM RECURSION] vs [RESULT FROM POW]
...
phi^30: [RESULT FROM RECURSION] vs [RESULT FROM POW]
```

You should see that the first few results should be identical, but at some point the two numbers start to differ significantly. This is because the recursion relation is _unstable_. It has and alternative solution which is $-(\sqrt{5} + 1)/2$. Any rounding error will mix a small part of this alternative solution into the results, and this mixture will grow exponentially. Choosing a good algorithm is really important!

Your source code should be written in `problem3.cpp`, and its output should be included in file `problem3.txt`. Commit and push both files to the homework repository.
